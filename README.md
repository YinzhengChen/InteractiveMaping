# InteractiveMaping

This project is an interactive web mapping application built with Mapbox GL JS. It visualizes US population density data on a choropleth map. Hover over each state to see its name and population density.

## How to Run

1. **Clone or download** the repository.
2. **Run a local server** (for example, using `python3 -m http.server`).
3. **Open** `pop_density.html` or `index.html` in your browser.

A Mapbox access token is provided in the code. If needed, replace it with your own token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com).

Enjoy exploring the interactive map!
